Street photography is one of the most challenging, but at the same time one of the most rewarding genres of photography. Documenting people in their everyday environment is not easy – it requires patience, hard work and sometimes even some bravery to be able to approach and photograph complete strangers. In this article, we will take a close look at what street photography is, how it differs from other genres of photography and provide some helpful tips to get you started.

Over my photographic journey, I have shot wildlife, travel, landscapes and even some sports. However, for me, street photography is the most challenging and satisfying genre. Why? Because street photography requires patience, persistence, and luck, like in wildlife photography. You need to have quick responses and react intuitively as you would shooting sports. Just like travel photography, you must master storytelling. And also, you must be able to thoughtfully and creatively compose a compelling shot which draws in your viewer, just like in landscape photography. If you think you might be interested in this type of photography, read on.

**What is Street Photography?**

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_photography#cite_note-1) defines street photography as “photography conducted for art or enquiry that features unmediated chance encounters and random incidents.”

Typically, street photography is about candidly capturing life in public areas. And contrary to its name, street photography does not have to be done on the streets. You can do street photography anywhere.

For example, when I lived in small-town Mississippi, I spent a lot of time at the beach. On rainy days, I often gravitate to museums, coffee shops or even the mall. One of my favorite places to shoot is on public transportation. You can always find great subjects on buses and trains.

And, don’t discard rural areas. Even if you don’t live in a big city, that shouldn’t hold you back from starting your street photography adventures.

**What Makes a Good Street Photograph?**

Right now, social media is flooded with mediocre and subpar street photography. Just pointing your lens in the direction of a person on the street does not qualify as street photography. As in all photography, how you compose your image will make or break your photograph.

A good street photo needs a clearly defined subject. All the rules (and I use that word loosely) of composition, such as rule of thirds, leading lines, use of negative space, symmetry, frames, etc. still hold. Try and tell a story with your images. Create photographs where the viewer pauses and asks questions.

These are the signs of good street photography.

When you first venture into street photography, don’t get too hung up on the definition. Instead, record street life from your own unique perspective. Experiment with different focal lengths, until you find one that resonates with you. Play with light and how it illuminates your subjects. But most of all, have fun.

If you want to hone your photographic skills and are up to the challenge of capturing emotions, gestures, and moments in time that tell a story, then give this genre of photography a try. If you do, you will find that capturing life on the streets in ways that makes the everyday seem extraordinary is extremely rewarding. Additionally, you will find that your photographic skills improve! Consequently, the things that you learn shooting street can be applied across the other genres of photography that you like to shoot.
